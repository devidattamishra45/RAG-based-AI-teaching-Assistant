## 📖 About The Project

> **Problem:** Students spend hours scrubbing through long video lectures to find specific concepts.  
> **Solution:** This project automates the extraction of knowledge from video content, allowing students to "chat" with their course material.

This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built . Unlike standard chatbots, this assistant is grounded in ground-truth data from course videos. It ingests video files, transcribes audio, generates vector embeddings, and retrieves precise context to answer student queries accurately.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **📹 automated Video Processing:** Extracts audio tracks from lecture recordings (`video_to_mp3.py`).
* **🗣️ Speech-to-Text Pipeline:** Converts audio data into structured JSON transcripts (`mp3_to_json.py`).
* **🧠 Vector Embeddings:** Uses `joblib` to store semantic embeddings of the course content for O(1) retrieval.
* **🔍 Context-Aware Answers:** Fetches the exact timestamp/context relevant to the user's question before generating a response.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

This project follows a linear ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline followed by a RAG query loop.

📂 Project Structure
The codebase is organized to separate data processing steps from the inference logic.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

FFmpeg (for video processing)

Installation
Clone the repository

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/devidattamishra45/RAG-based-AI-teaching-Assistant.git](https://github.com/devidattamishra45/RAG-based-AI-teaching-Assistant.git)
cd RAG-based-AI-teaching-Assistant
Install dependencies

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: Ensure libraries like joblib, openai, moviepy or torch are installed)

⚡ Usage Guide
This pipeline is designed to be run sequentially when adding new course material.

1. Ingest Data
Place your lecture video in the project root.

Bash

# Extract audio
python video_to_mp3.py

# Transcribe to text
python mp3_to_json.py

# Build the Knowledge Base (Embeddings)
python preprocess_json.py
2. Ask a Question
Once the embeddings.joblib file is ready, you can query the system:

Bash

python process_incoming.py
The script will prompt you for a question and return the answer based strictly on the course material.
